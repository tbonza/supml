Supervised machine learning algorithms -- excluding neural networks. These
algorithms are based off of class assignments. This means the algorithms
have been largely designed and used from a research perspective. However,
we do try to use efficient operations whenever possible; such as
vectorization.

See R documentation for basic usage.
